# hystrix-event-stream-clj

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unbounce/hystrix-event-stream-clj.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unbounce/hystrix-event-stream-clj)

Easy way to setup a Hystrix (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) event stream without having to use servlets.

## Install

Add to your `project.clj`

```
:dependencies [ ;; ..
                [hystrix-event-stream-clj "0.2.0"]
                ;; ..
              ]
```

https://clojars.org/hystrix-event-stream-clj

## Usage with Aleph

```clojure
 (ns example.handler
  (:require [aleph.server :as http]
            [com.netflix.hystrix.core :refer [defcommand]]
            [hystrix-event-stream-clj.core :refer [hystrix-stream]))

(defcommand hello
  "Safe hello!"
  []
  "Hello world!")

(defn ring-app [req]
  (cond
    (= (:request-uri req) "/")
    {:status 200 :headers {} :body (hello)}

    (= (:request-uri req) "/hystrix.stream")
    (hystrix-stream)

    :else
    {:status 404 :body "not found" :headers {}}))

(defn -main
  [port]
  (http/start-server ring-app {:port (Integer. port)}))
```

Test the event stream by curling:

```
curl locahost:5000/hystrix.stream

data: []

data: []
```

## But Why?

The event stream can be consumed by the Hystrix Dashboard. Giving you pretty mointoring of all circuit breakers.
