# hystrix-event-stream-clj

Easy way to setup a Hystrix (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) event stream without
having to use servlets.

## Getting Started

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/luchiniatwork/hystrix-event-stream-clj/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/luchiniatwork/hystrix-event-stream-clj)

## Usage

The function `mk-hystrix-stream-req-handler` in the `hystrix-event-stream-clj.core`
namespace returns a map with two entries:

* `:metric-stream-future` - a future that can be canceled to stop collecting metrics
* `:request-handler` - a request handler to be attached to your web server routing system

Here's an example of attaching the returned `request-handler` to a Pedestal route:

```clojure
#{["/hystrix.stream"
   :get request-handler
   :route-name :hystrix-stream]}
```

If you need to cancel the collection of metrics, cancel the future with:

```clojure
(future-cancel metric-stream-future)
```

## In Action

Assuming the endpoint you attach the request-handler to was `http://localhost:5000/hystrix.streamTest`, you can test the event stream by curling:

```
curl http://locahost:5000/hystrix.stream

data: []

data: []
```

## The Real Fun

This stream makes it possible to connect your Hystrix-enabled servers with a
[Hystrix Dashboard](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-dashboard)
(or [Hystrix Turbine](https://github.com/Netflix/Turbine)).
You will be able to see something like this on your dashboard:

## Recommended Usage with Components

It's recommended to wrap `hystrix-event-stream-clj` in a Component to make initialization
and dependency management easier:

```clojure
(ns my-project.components.hystrix-stream
  (:require [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
            [hystrix-event-stream-clj.core :as stream]))

(defrecord HystrixStream [request-handler metric-stream-future]
  component/Lifecycle
  (start [this]
    (println "HystrixStream: starting...")
    (let [{:keys [request-handler metric-stream-future]}
          (stream/mk-hystrix-stream-req-handler)]
      (assoc this
             :metric-stream-future metric-stream-future
             :request-handler request-handler)))
  
  (stop [this]
    (println "HystrixStream: stopping...")
    (if metric-stream-future
      (future-cancel metric-stream-future))
    (assoc this :metric-stream-future nil)))

(defn new-hystrix-stream []
  (map->HystrixStream {}))

```

Then just injecting it in your system with:

```clojure
(component/system-map
  ;; Hystrix Stream as a dependency
  :hystrix-stream (hystrix-stream/new-hystrix-stream))
```

## Acknowledgements

This project is an updated fork from [hystrix-event-stream-clj](https://github.com/josephwilk/hystrix-event-stream-clj)
by Joseph Wilk. I needed this on a project and his codebase was pretty dated. Most of the legwork
was done by him.
